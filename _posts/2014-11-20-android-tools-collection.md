Here I summarise some android tools I developed.

####1. Marking tools for SZWW and Haiquanwan

This app can mark the routes and POIs in SZWWW and HQW, which uses OCN's online map. You can use menu button to switch to Route Marking Model or POI Marking Model.

For Window of the World in Shenzhen, please use [DrawMarker-SZWW.apk](http://haidaoxiaofei.me/d/DrawMarker-SZWW.apk).

For Haiquanwan in Zhuhai, please use [DrawMarker-HQW.apk](http://haidaoxiaofei.me/d/DrawMarker-HQW.apk).

If you are interested in the [source code](https://bitbucket.org/haidaoxiaofei/drawmarker), please contact me.
