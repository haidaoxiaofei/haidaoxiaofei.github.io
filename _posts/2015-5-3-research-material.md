Research life is a colourful journey, which you should enjoy, otherwise, why continue it?

I find some useful materials recently. I post this article just to collect them and try to help every research newbie, like me..

##1. Research skills
Some good MS guy already collected a lot of useful resources for researchers. Here is the [link](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm). Hope you like it.

##2. How to write research papers
[Donald E. Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/) not only wrote the famous algorithm book, but also gave some advises to researchers when writing mathematical papers. The book is [Mathematical Writing](http://haidaoxiaofei.me/d/mathwriting.pdf).

##3. Give a good research talk

Here is a [slides](http://haidaoxiaofei.me/d/tsinghua-mar-2013.pdf) talking about how to give a good research talk, although itself is not good enough.. The ideas are still very useful.

##4. How to read research papers

Are you still always reading a paper from the begin to the end? Try to read this [paper](http://haidaoxiaofei.me/d/paper-reading.pdf) first. Then you may save a large amount of time from reading worthless papers.

I will update this article if new resources discovered.
