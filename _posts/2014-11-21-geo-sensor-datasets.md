This article lists some Geo datasets.

####1. GeoLife GPS Trajectories

This [GPS trajectory dataset](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/b16d359d-d164-469e-9fd4-daa38f2b2e13/) was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by 182 users in a period of over three years (from April 2007 to August 2012). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of about 1.2 million kilometers and a total duration of 48,000+ hours. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers and GPS-phones, and have a variety of sampling rates. 91 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5 seconds or every 5~10 meters per point. This dataset recoded a broad range of users’ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation. 

####2. T-Drive Trajectory Data Sample

This is [a sample of T-Drive trajectory dataset](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=152883) that contains a one-week trajectories of 10,357 taxis. The total number of points in this dataset is about 15 million and the total distance of the trajectories reaches 9 million kilometers.

####3. SmartSantander

[SmartSantander](http://www.smartsantander.eu) proposes a unique in the world city-scale experimental research facility in support of typical applications and services for a smart city. This unique experimental facility will be sufficiently large, open and flexible to enable horizontal and vertical federation with other experimental facilities and stimulates development of new applications by users of various types including experimental advanced research on IoT technologies and realistic assessment of users’ acceptability tests. The project envisions the deployment of 20,000 sensors in Belgrade, Guildford, Lübeck and Santander (12,000), exploiting a large variety of technologies. There is [a map view](http://maps.smartsantander.eu) of SmartSantander. You should try it.


####4. Berkeley's Mobile Century Data

The [Mobile Century data](http://traffic.berkeley.edu/project/downloads/mobilecenturydata) was collected on February 8, 2008, as part of a joint UC Berkeley - Nokia project, funded by the California Department of Transportation, to support the exploration of uses of GPS enabled phones to monitor traffic. In addition to the cell phone GPS data, two additional data sources are available for the experiment site. Inductive loop detector data obtained through the Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS), and travel time data obtained through vehicle re-identification using high resolution video data are included with this release. All identifiers assigned to the cell phones used during the Mobile Century experiment have been randomized to protect the participants in the experiment. The video data is also processed and random number has been assigned to represent each vehicle. 

####5. IEEE ICDM Contest 2010 (Synthetic)

This [contest](http://tunedit.org/challenge/IEEE-ICDM-2010/gps) provides a quite large volume of synthetic traffic data. Maybe sometime this dataset could be used to test something. I have no idea.
